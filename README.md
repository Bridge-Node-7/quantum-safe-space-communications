# Quantum Readiness for Space Communications

Evidence-based assessment and migration-planning framework for post-quantum cryptography across spacecraft, satellite links, ground systems, mission operations, and supporting vendors.

This repository helps teams identify cryptographic dependencies, document quantum-era exposure, plan migration, and assemble a human-reviewed **Quantum Readiness Decision Pack**.

It is documentation-first. It provides methods, templates, examples, and validation tools. It does not connect to live systems, implement cryptography, or issue certification or operational authorization.

For a first review, open the fictional Decision Pack before filling in a blank template. It shows the expected structure, evidence links, unknowns, critical conditions, actions, limitations, and decision record.

## What You Need Before Starting

Use the framework only after defining:

- the authorized systems, links, data, vendors, and lifecycle stages in scope;
- an accountable scope owner and the intended decision;
- information-handling rules for mission, customer, vendor, security, and controlled data;
- available architecture, configuration, certificate, firmware, software, test, and vendor evidence;
- known exclusions, assumptions, review dates, and reassessment triggers.

Do not treat missing information as favorable evidence.

## Core Workflow

1. [Define scope, boundaries, owners, and exclusions](assessment/quantum-readiness-space-communications-assessment.md).
2. [Map spacecraft, ground, cloud, vendor, update, recovery, and communications paths](assessment/link-map-template.md).
3. [Inventory algorithms, protocols, certificates, libraries, firmware, keys, trust anchors, and vendor dependencies](assessment/crypto-inventory-template.md).
4. [Record Quantum Exposure Severity for each material scope item](assessment/quantum-exposure-severity.md).
5. [Profile migration readiness across ten separate domains](assessment/migration-readiness-profile.md).
6. [Record evidence confidence, provenance, currency, conflicts, and coverage](assessment/evidence-confidence-ledger.md).
7. [Evaluate all twelve Critical Risk Overrides](assessment/critical-risk-overrides.md).
8. [Assign accountable owners, actions, resources, due dates, and escalation paths](assessment/ownership-matrix-template.md).
9. [Build the migration and recovery roadmap](frameworks/pqc-migration-roadmap.md).
10. [Assemble and review the Quantum Readiness Decision Pack](decision-pack/README.md).

Start with inventory. Do not make a favorable exposure or readiness statement before the relevant systems, cryptography, owners, and evidence are in scope.

## What the Decision Pack Contains

The framework keeps four decision inputs separate:

1. **Quantum Exposure Severity** records concern for each asset, link, protocol, trust function, update path, vendor dependency, or protected data set.
2. **Migration Readiness Profile** records demonstrated capability across ten non-compensating domains.
3. **Evidence Confidence and Coverage** records support strength, provenance, currency, conflicts, exclusions, and unassessed critical scope.
4. **Critical Risk Overrides** preserve conditions that cannot be canceled by progress elsewhere.

The completed package also records scope, ownership, actions, vendor and standards applicability, migration and recovery planning, decisions, approvals, limitations, dissent, review history, and reassessment triggers.

## How to Interpret Results

- Higher exposure severity means greater concern.
- Higher readiness stages mean stronger demonstrated migration capability.
- Evidence strength is separate from exposure and readiness.
- Critical conditions cannot be averaged away.
- `Unknown / Not Assessed` remains visible until supported evidence is available.
- `Not Applicable` requires sufficient evidence, a written rationale, an accountable decision owner, and a reassessment trigger.
- Do not combine the four decision inputs into one aggregate readiness number.

These human-governed postures support planning only:

- **Assessment Incomplete**
- **Evidence Required**
- **Critical Action Required**
- **Executive Decision Required**
- **Ready for Governed Migration**

The postures are not certification, compliance determination, deployment approval, flight qualification, operational authorization, or proof that a system is quantum-safe.

## Who It Helps

The framework is useful for:

- spacecraft, satellite, payload, ground-station, and mission-operations teams;
- cybersecurity, cryptography, mission-assurance, and systems-engineering reviewers;
- program, procurement, supply-chain, vendor-management, and governance teams;
- commercial, civil, defense, national-security, international, and research programs applying their own authorized requirements;
- analysts and reviewers preparing evidence-linked planning artifacts for human review.

## Repository Map

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `assessment/` | Scope, link map, cryptographic inventory, exposure, readiness, evidence, critical-condition, ownership, vendor, and executive templates |
| `briefings/` | Action-planning templates |
| `decision-pack/` | Final deliverable assembly, decision summary, and review record |
| `docs/` | Methodology, evidence, standards, technical context, limitations, and reading paths |
| `examples/` | Complete fictional worked example |
| `frameworks/` | Migration and recovery roadmap |
| `release/` | Release metadata and reproducibility records |
| `tests/` | Positive and adversarial methodology tests |
| `tools/` | Repository, link, public-boundary, manifest, and packaging validators |

## Validate the Repository

Git Bash or another Bash environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-validation.txt
bash scripts/validate.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements-validation.txt
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate.ps1
```

Hosted continuous integration also runs network-aware link checks. To enable those checks locally:

```bash
VALIDATE_NETWORK=1 bash scripts/validate.sh
```

The validators check repository integrity and methodology boundaries. They do not calculate an assessment result.

## Publicly Distributable Use

Use fictional or explicitly authorized information only. Do not publish credentials, keys, tokens, controlled technical data, real mission architecture, sensitive hostnames, private vendor responses, customer information, or security weaknesses that could enable targeting.

Before publishing any completed artifact, apply the required privacy, security, export-control, contractual, intellectual-property, and mission-sensitivity review for your environment.

## Limits and Responsible Use

Read [Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md), [Public Claim Boundaries](docs/public-claim-boundaries.md), [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md), and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

This framework supports evidence-based planning. It does not replace cryptographic engineering, mission engineering, safety review, legal analysis, contracting decisions, standards applicability determinations, or formal authorization processes.
